#Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and Data-Related Jobs Salaries 2024

This dataset contains global information about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data-related job salaries. It was obtained from AI Jobs and is published in the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 license, allowing unrestricted use.

As AI and machine learning continue to transform industries, the demand for skilled professionals in these fields is growing rapidly. Roles such as Data Scientist, Research Engineer, and Machine Learning Engineer are becoming critical across sectors, from technology startups to large enterprises. I sought to analyze this dataset to uncover valuable insights into compensation trends for these roles, offering a global perspective on salary distribution across various experience levels, employment types, company sizes, and geographical locations.

Understanding salary trends is essential for both employers and professionals as they navigate a competitive landscape. For job seekers, this data provides insight into how factors such as experience, remote work, and company size influence salaries. For employers, it serves as a benchmark for attracting and retaining top talent in this evolving field.

## The questions I aim to answer with this dataset are:
* What is the average salary for different roles (e.g., Data Scientist, Research Engineer) across various experience levels?
* How does the remote work ratio affect salaries across different regions or job roles?
* How do salaries differ across regions (employee residence vs. company location)?
* What is the average salary based on different employment types (full-time, part-time, contract)?
* How does company size influence salaries across job titles or experience levels?
